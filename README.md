# Superstore Gold Membership Prediction - README

This dataset contains information about a superstore's upcoming year-end sale, where they plan to offer a gold membership with a 20% discount on all purchases, priced at $499 during the campaign period (typically $999). The membership offer is targeted at existing customers, and the marketing campaign will be conducted through phone calls. 

### Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that identifies customers most likely to purchase the gold membership. By classifying the customers' likelihood of purchase, the superstore can minimize campaign costs by focusing efforts on the most responsive customers.

### Dataset Description
The dataset includes various customer attributes such as purchase history, demographics, and past interactions with the store. Analysis of this data is necessary to understand the factors influencing customer behavior and to build a model that accurately predicts positive responses to the offer.
