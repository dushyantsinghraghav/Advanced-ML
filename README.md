This repository showcases a collection of advanced machine learning notebooks, covering a diverse range of techniques and methodologies that I have applied to different datasets. Each notebook represents practical applications of machine learning concepts, designed to solve specific problems and provide insights into various ML algorithms and frameworks.

## Notebooks

1. **Different Feature Engineering Techniques**: This notebook dives into various feature engineering strategies, showcasing how transformations and feature manipulations can enhance model performance. It explores feature scaling, encoding, polynomial features, and interaction terms, providing insights into the impact of each technique on model predictions.

2. **Kernalized SVM (Support Vector Machine)**: Here, I applied a Kernelized SVM algorithm to demonstrate the power of kernel functions in separating non-linear data. This notebook includes hyperparameter tuning, visualization of decision boundaries, and comparison with linear models.

3. **MLflow Crash Course by DagsHub Part 1**: This is an introductory guide to MLflow, where I document experiment tracking and model versioning with DagsHub. The notebook shows how MLflow can streamline the machine learning workflow by tracking different stages of model development.

4. **Neural Network for Cancer Dataset**: This notebook implements a neural network from scratch for a cancer dataset, providing a deep learning approach to classification. It includes network architecture selection, training, and evaluation, demonstrating the application of neural networks in medical data.

5. **PCA Tutorial**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is covered in this tutorial, where I use PCA for dimensionality reduction, showcasing its effect on model performance and visualization of data in reduced dimensions.

6. **Jane Marketing NB**: In this Kaggle notebook, I built a model to predict marketing outcomes for a Jane Street competition. The focus is on handling complex financial data, implementing predictive modeling, and optimizing performance metrics relevant to the competition.

7. **Predict Response to Gold Membership Campaign**: This notebook models customer responses to a Gold Membership marketing campaign. It explores customer segmentation, predictive modeling, and A/B testing approaches to improve campaign effectiveness.

Each notebook is designed to highlight my skills in advanced machine learning, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.
